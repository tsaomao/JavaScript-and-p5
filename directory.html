    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Greetings and Welcome! This file is named "directory.html" so that it doesn't override your ability to browse these files - in case I don't keep up with the updates while I create content and examples here.</p>
    <p>These branching subdirectories will host the javascript and HTML that I create while learning <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> and <a href="http://brm.io/matter-js/">matter.js</a> from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman">The Coding Train</a>.</p>    
    <p>The root directory for all this is <a href="http://www.malcolmgin.com/CodingTrain/">hosted on my website</a>.</p>
    <p>Here's <a href="https://github.com/tsaomao/JavaScript-and-p5/tree/master">the GitHub Repository</a>.</p>
    <p>In almost all cases you need to open a web page that will in turn exectute Javascript within the browser window, so all you should need to view these examples is a web browser. Using GitHub, you can also view the source code within your browser.</p>
    <h2>Directory</h2>
    <p><ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.malcolmgin.com/CodingTrain/Templates/">Templates</a><br />For templates provided by packages, or templates I've made to make further coding and writing more convenient.
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://www.malcolmgin.com/CodingTrain/Templates/p5-empty-example/">p5-empty-example</a><br />Examples provided here come directly from the p5.js project. The only change I made (for purposes of browsing via HTTP/WebDAV) is to change the filenames from index.html to index1.html.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><a href="http://www.malcolmgin.com/CodingTrain/p5%20Exp/">p5 Exp</a><br />My own experiments or inspired by early lessons based on The Coding Train. Note that each index*.html corresponds to a sketch*.js file, which is what gets executed in the index*.html in the browser.</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.malcolmgin.com/CodingTrain/Lessons/">Lessons</a><br />I'll come up with some sort of nomenclature in subdirectories or filenames that corresponds in some way to The Coding Train's video lectures and exercises.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>It's also my intention to comment the JavaScript files so that the code is somehow explicable to the casual browser.</p>
